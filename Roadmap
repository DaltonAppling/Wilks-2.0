# Tasks to be completed.

# Sprint 1
-[x] Create new repository for code and link it to team.
-[x] Find X repository and determine usefulness to scope of project.
-[x] Test X repository for its useful features. Document adjustments to make it work as comment.

# Sprint 2
-[x] Find out what it takes to (and determine if I can) create a GUI for this program.
# It appears that creating a new GUI from scratch is outside of the scope of this class. I have determined that the time investment is not currently possible for me to complete. 
# Program will be completed as code only. No GUI will be involved at this time.
-[] begin coding for portion 1 (athlete tracking)
# Above step may be ommited if it is deemed too time consuming in terms of time alloted for project or inefficient for meet directors.
-[] Begin coding for Wilks 2.0 calculation.
